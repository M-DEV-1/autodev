## The Stack

### **1. Agentic Core (Cline)**
At the heart of AutoDev lies the **Cline** protocol. We utilize Cline's robust file system capabilities and terminal execution environment to give the agent distinct "hands."
*   **Sandboxed Execution**: Every command runs in a secure, monitored PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) instance.
*   **File Operations**: Complex diffing and file manipulation strategies ensure code integrity during massive refactors.
*   **Tool Use**: The agent autonomously decides when to read files, run builds, or browse documentation.

### **2. Workflow Orchestration (Kestra)**
Reliability is paramount in autonomous systems. **Kestra** provides the orchestration layer that governs the agent's lifecycle.
*   **Pipeline Management**: Kestra handles the "invisible" work—managing state persistence, handling retries for failed agent steps, and triggering deployment workflows.
*   **Event-Driven**: When you push to a repository, Kestra signals AutoDev to wake up, pull the changes, and prepare the environment.

### **3. Validation & Review (CodeRabbit)**
AutoDev doesn't verify its own work in a vacuum. We integrate with **CodeRabbit** to provide an adversarial review layer.
*   **Continuous Feedback**: Every change generated by the agent is analyzed for logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and anti-patterns.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: The review findings are fed back into the agent's context window, allowing it to self-correct before the user ever sees a bug.

### **4. Edge Deployment (Vercel)**
The final mile is handled by **Vercel**.
*   **Instant Previews**: The frontend (Next.js) is automatically built and deployed to Vercel's edge network.
*   **Zero Config**: AutoDev manages the `vercel.json` and environment variables, ensuring that "Prompt to Production" is literal, not figurative.
